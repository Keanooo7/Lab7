# Check For Understanding:
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
 
  - ( Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed ) 
  - Manually run them locally before pushing code
  - Run them all after all development is completed

I would integrate my end‑to‑end tests within a GitHub Action, This is because it gives me immediate, continuous feedback on whether a change breaks the main brachs existing functionality. these tests would also provide better visibility to my teamates on my testing.
